- 👀 We design and build language technology for Indigenous and Low Resource language speakers.
- 🌱 Our models train on Universal Dependencies annotated corpus: parsing CoNLL-U annotated corpus precisely into PyTorch bi-LSTM models that train on immersion cooled GPUs.
- :microscope: We train foundation models for syntactic performance, investing in morphologically complex languages / dialects.
- :wrench: Foundation models will power applications: named entity resolution, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, question and answer, information extraction and search.
- :satellite: We deploy seamlessly to Cloud, Desktop and Mobile (Android) using Intel openVINO.
- 💞️ We joined the Intel Liftoff program in early 2024 and the Denvr Ai Ascend program in August 2025.
- :unlock: We contribute many models as open sourced - see license.txt for details in each section.
