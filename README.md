- 👀 We design and build language technology for Indigenous and Low Resource language speakers.
- 🌱 Our models train on Universal Dependencies annotated corpus by parsing CoNLL-U symbolic information into bi-LSTM neural models that train on immersion cooled GPUs. All model power usage and pollution are published in each model card.
- :microscope: symbolic instructions are perfect for morphosyntactically complex languages / dialects with sparse availability of training data.
- 💻 Our current solutions are dependency parsers and grammar checkers in 24 languages. They can be downloaded to run on Windows OS and Ubuntu OS, with Android and MAC OS / iOS under development.
- :wrench: Foundation models power downstream applications: named entity resolution, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, question and answer, information extraction and search.
- :satellite: We deploy seamlessly to Cloud, Desktop and Mobile (Android) using Intel openVINO. We design for older CPUs and devices (minimum of 2 GB RAM), and do not support iOS and MAC OS. Each repo will have localized instructions, apologies it will take some time to implement 🤝
- 👩‍💻 We joined the Intel Liftoff program in early 2024 and the Denvr Ai Ascend program in August 2025.
- :unlock: We contribute many models as open sourced - see license.txt for details in each section.
